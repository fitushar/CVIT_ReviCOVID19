## Datastets

This study ustilized a large cohort of open-access clinical CT and CXR for model developement and evaluation alongside the simulated CT and CXR


A total of 16,949 CT scans of 11,166 patients were used for model development and testing.
There were ten clinical datasets: RICORD, MosMed,BIMCV-COVID-19 +/- (BIMCV-V2),
COVID-CT-MD, CT Images in COVID-19,PleThora, COVID19-CT-dataset, Stony Brook
University COVID-19 Positive Cases (COVID-19-NY-SBU), A Large-Scale CT and PET/CT Dataset
for Lung Cancer Diagnosis (Lungs-CT-Dx), and Lung Image Database Consortium / Image Database
Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI). These ten clinical datasets were united into the U-10 CT Dataset.
Additionally, simulated data were from the Center for Virtual Imaging Trials CT Dataset, Duke-CVIT-
CT.

# CT Analysis -- /ct_analysis
### COVID-19 case-level detection using CT

This project, developed by Fakrul Islam Tushar at Duke University, is aimed at classifying COVID-19 cases using the Uniter-10-Dataset. The model utilizes 3D ResNet architecture for efficient and accurate classification.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

- Docker container `ft42/cvit:ft42tf26` with all the necessary libraries pre-installed.
- NVIDIA GPU with at least 11 GB of memory (3x11 GB recommended for optimal performance).

## Project Structure- Training

- `Sample_Data/`: Contains the dataset required for training.
  - `mosmed_tfrecords_96x160x160/`: Main data folder.
  - `data_cache/`: Stores cache data during runtime.
- `Logs_And_Weights_StorageFolder/`: Stores model logs and weights.
  - Model weights and logs are saved in designated subfolders.
  - A CSV log file is also generated during training.
- `training_lossweight_calc_csv/`: Contains sample CSV files for weighted loss functions.
- `config.py`: Configuration script to set up model parameters and training settings.
- `train.py`: Main training script.

## Setup

1. Pull the Docker container:
   ```
   docker pull ft42/cvit:ft42tf26
   ```
2. Run the Docker container (example command):
   ```
   nvidia-docker run -it --name=ft42_demorun -v /home/ft42/:/Sharedfolder:z -v /local/usr/ft42/:/local:z -v /image_data/:/image_data:z -v /image_data2/:/image_data2:z -v /data2/:/data2:z -v /data/:/data:z -v /ssd0/:/ssd0:z -v /net_data/:/net_data:z ft42/cvit:ft42tf26
   ```
3. Modify `config.py` to suit your requirements, such as the number of GPUs, batch size, and model capacity.

## Running the Project

To start the training process, execute the following command:

```
python train.py
```

This will initiate the training process, with logs and model weights being saved in the `Logs_And_Weights_StorageFolder`.


Using 3 NVIDIA GPUs with 11 GB each, a batch size of 24, and a mini-batch size of 8, the model takes approximately 15 seconds per epoch.



Based on your deployment JSON configuration and the command provided for inference, I'll draft a README that focuses on the deployment and testing aspects of your project.

# Testing Guide for COVID-19 case-level detection using CT

This guide provides instructions for deploying and testing the COVID-19 classification model on the BIMCV dataset using a pre-configured JSON file and a Python script.

## Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the following setup before proceeding:

- Properly configured environment with necessary dependencies installed.
- Access to the specified directories and files as mentioned in the deployment JSON configuration.

## Deployment Configuration

The deployment configuration is provided in a JSON file (`bimcv.json`). Key parameters include:

- `DATASET_TO_RUN_ON`: Specifies the dataset to be used for inference, set to "bimcv".
- `NAME_TO_SAVE`: Name under which the model outputs will be saved.
- `PATH_TO_SAVE_LOGS`: Directory path for saving logs.
- `INFERENCE_MODE`, `COMPUTE_AUC`, `INPUT_FORMAT`: Various settings related to inference and evaluation.
- `RESAMPLING`, `PATCH_SIZE`, `MODEL_PATH`: Parameters related to image preprocessing and the model.

Ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up according to your deployment needs.

## Running Inference

To run the inference, use the following command:

```
python deploy.py --gpu 0 --config deploy_configs/MODEL-bimcv-Dataset-Test-bimcv.json
```

This command specifies the GPU to use (`--gpu 0`) and the path to the configuration file (`--config`).

## Output

The inference script will process the specified dataset and generate outputs according to the configuration. Logs and results will be stored in the directory specified in the `PATH_TO_SAVE_LOGS` parameter.

## Post-Inference Steps

After inference, you may want to:

- Review the logs for any errors or warnings.
- Analyze the output files for model performance, including AUC if `COMPUTE_AUC` is set to "True".
- Compare the results with expected outcomes or benchmarks.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all paths in the configuration file are accessible and correct.
- Verify that the model file specified in `MODEL_PATH` exists and is compatible with the deployment script.
- Check GPU availability and utilization if encountering issues related to resource allocation.
